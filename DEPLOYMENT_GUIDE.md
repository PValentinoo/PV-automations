# Deployment Guide - Fixing Routing Issues

## Problem
When deploying your React app, the PrivacyPolicy page (and other routes) work fine locally but fail when published. This is a common issue with Single Page Applications (SPAs) that use client-side routing.

## Root Cause
The issue occurs because:
1. Your app uses React Router for client-side routing
2. When deployed, the server doesn't know how to handle routes like `/privatlivspolitik`
3. The server tries to find a file at that path, but it doesn't exist
4. This results in a 404 error

## Solution
I've created configuration files for different hosting platforms. These files tell the server to redirect all requests to `index.html`, allowing React Router to handle the routing on the client side.

## Configuration Files Created

### 1. `public/_redirects` (Netlify)
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### 2. `vercel.json` (Vercel)
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. `public/.htaccess` (Apache servers)
```
Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]
```

## Hosting Platform Specific Instructions

### Netlify
- The `_redirects` file will automatically be used
- No additional configuration needed

### Vercel
- The `vercel.json` file will automatically be used
- No additional configuration needed

### Apache Server
- The `.htaccess` file will automatically be used
- Ensure Apache has `mod_rewrite` enabled

### Other Platforms
- **Firebase Hosting**: Add to `firebase.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "hosting": {
      "public": "dist",
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "**",
          "destination": "/index.html"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

- **GitHub Pages**: Create a `404.html` that redirects to `index.html`
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Configure CloudFront to redirect 404s to `index.html`

## Testing Your Fix

1. **Rebuild your app**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test locally** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. **Deploy** with the new configuration files

4. **Test the routes**:
   - Navigate directly to `/privatlivspolitik`
   - Refresh the page on any route
   - Use browser back/forward buttons

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Still getting 404s?
- Ensure the configuration files are in the correct location
- Check that your hosting platform supports the configuration
- Verify the files are included in your build output

### Routes work but page refreshes fail?
- This is the same issue - the configuration files should fix it
- Check that your hosting platform is using the correct configuration

### Build errors?
- Ensure all configuration files are in the right directories
- Check for syntax errors in JSON files

## Additional Notes

- The `_redirects` file must be in the `public` folder to be copied to the build output
- The `vercel.json` file should be in the root directory
- The `.htaccess` file must be in the `public` folder
- These configurations only affect routing - they don't change your app's functionality

## Support

If you're still experiencing issues after implementing these fixes:
1. Check your hosting platform's documentation for SPA routing
2. Verify the configuration files are properly formatted
3. Ensure the files are deployed to the correct locations
