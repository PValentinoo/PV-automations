Product Requirements Document – Custom Solutions Consultation Website
Overview

This document describes the requirements for a new website showcasing a custom solutions consulting service. The website’s purpose is to present the service’s capabilities and encourage potential clients to book a consultation. The business philosophy is captured by the tagline: “Even small ideas can ignite a big change – let’s talk” (in Danish: “Selv små idéer kan skabe store forandringer – lad os tale sammen”). The site will use this slogan prominently on the homepage to set the tone.

A product requirements document defines a product’s purpose, features, functionality, and behavior

. In this case, the “product” is the promotional website itself. The site’s key audiences are business clients and organizations looking for innovative solutions or collaborations.

Objectives

Primary Objective: Showcase the service’s custom solutions and secure collaboration inquiries. The main call-to-action is to book a consultation with the consultant.

Secondary Objective: Build credibility by presenting a portfolio of example projects. Although examples are shown, they represent just a sample of what the service can do (“…og meget mere” – “…and much more”).

Public Visibility: All site content is publicly accessible (no login). The site should clearly promote transparency and invite engagement.

Language: All content on the website must be in Danish (for now, the PRD is in English for development purposes).

Target Audience

Potential clients include startups, entrepreneurs, and companies seeking creative, tailor-made solutions. They value innovation and collaboration. The tone of the site should be professional yet approachable, inspiring trust and creativity. It should emphasize that even small projects are welcomed and that the consultant is enthusiastic about collaboration.

Core Features

Homepage with Hero Section: A prominent hero/landing section featuring the tagline “Even small ideas can ignite a big change – let’s talk” (with the Danish version displayed) and a clear call-to-action button (e.g. “Book en konsultation” or “Lad os tale sammen”).

Examples/Portfolio Section: A visual showcase of example custom solutions. For example, illustrate prior projects (each with a brief caption) such as:

Responsive website development

Mobile app design or development

Branding and visual identity projects

Digital marketing campaigns

Interactive product demonstrations or prototypes

...and more creative, custom solutions
Indicate in copy that these are just examples (for instance with “…og mere” text).

Services/Offerings Section: A section describing the range of custom solutions offered. This can be a list or short paragraphs summarizing the capabilities (e.g., “Vi leverer skræddersyede løsninger inden for [felter], herunder …”). Emphasize that each solution is tailored to the client.

Contact/Consultation Page: A page or section with contact information and a form to book a consultation. Include fields for name, email, organization, and a brief message or project idea. This section should reassure visitors and encourage them to reach out (e.g. “Lad os tage en uforpligtende snak”).

Footer: Include basic contact details, social media links if available, and copyright. Keep it minimal.

(Optional) About Section: A short about-me or about-us blurb for credibility (e.g. experience, expertise, values). This can appear on the homepage or a separate page.

Content and Messaging

Language: All copy, headings, and navigation labels must be in Danish. For example, menu items should be “Hjem” (Home), “Eksempler” (Examples), “Ydelser” (Services), “Om” (About), and “Kontakt” (Contact).

Tone: Friendly, inspiring, and confident. The messaging should convey that small ideas are valuable and that collaboration can lead to big changes. The text should emphasize that even small projects are welcomed and that the consultant’s enthusiasm is genuine.

Tagline: Use the slogan prominently in the hero section. A suggested Danish version is “Selv små idéer kan skabe store forandringer – lad os tale sammen.” Make this headline large and eye-catching on the homepage.

Call to Action: Use motivating button text such as “Book en gratis konsultation” or “Kontakt mig for samarbejde”. These calls-to-action should be clearly visible (e.g., in the hero and in the footer) to guide users to reach out.

Navigation and Structure

The website will have a simple, intuitive navigation. Key pages/sections include:

Home (Forside): Hero with tagline + CTA, a brief intro sentence about the service, and possibly a summary of capabilities.

Examples/Portfolio (Eksempler): Gallery or list of example project types (as above). Each example should include a short description or caption.

Services (Ydelser): [Optional] A page listing types of custom solutions (e.g. “Webdesign”, “App-udvikling”, “Branding”) to illustrate the breadth of offerings.

About (Om): [Optional] A short introduction to the consultant or company (experience, skills).

Contact (Kontakt): Contact form (as described above) and contact information.
Navigation labels and page headings should be in Danish and clearly indicate each section’s purpose.

Design Guidelines

Layout: Clean, modern, and uncluttered. Use ample whitespace and simple, readable fonts. The design should reflect professionalism and creativity.

Responsiveness: The site must be fully responsive on mobile and tablet, ensuring text and images scale properly.

Colors & Images: Use a palette that feels vibrant yet professional (e.g., blues or teals with white backgrounds). Include relevant images or icons (e.g., generic tech or creative images) in the examples section. Ensure images align with an innovative theme.

Typography: Headings and body text should be legible and support Danish characters (æ, ø, å). Choose fonts that convey a friendly yet professional tone.

Accessibility: Ensure good contrast and readable font sizes. Buttons and links should be easily tappable on mobile.

Branding: If a logo exists, include it in the header. If not, use the consultant’s name or company name in the site title.

Technical Requirements

Development: The site will be built using Lovable AI; this PRD will be used as the prompt. Lovable should generate a React-based static site according to these specifications.

Language: All generated text should be in Danish, as specified in the PRD.

Contact Form: The form should capture inquiries and either send them via email or log them for follow-up. Include form validation (e.g. required fields).

Performance: The site should load quickly. Optimize images and keep scripts minimal.

SEO: Use Danish meta tags (title, description) and semantic HTML (H1, H2, etc.) for headings to improve search visibility.

Public Access: No authentication is required; all content is accessible to any visitor.

Hosting: The site can be deployed as a static site (e.g., on Netlify or Vercel).

Content Examples

For clarity, here are sample text snippets (in Danish) illustrating the desired style and messaging:

Hero: “Selv små idéer kan skabe store forandringer – lad os tale sammen.”

Intro sentence: “Jeg hjælper virksomheder med at realisere deres idéer gennem skræddersyede digitale løsninger.”

Service labels: “Skræddersyet webdesign”, “Mobilapp-udvikling”, “Branding og visuel identitet”.

Portfolio captions: “Eksempel: Webshop for lokal håndværker”, “Eksempel: Mobilapp til intern kommunikation”, “… og mange flere kreative løsninger.”

Contact CTA: “Kontakt mig i dag for et uforpligtende møde.”

Summary

This website will serve as the public face of the custom solutions consultancy. It highlights example projects (noting that many more are possible), emphasizes innovation and approachability, and drives visitors to book a consultation. All instructions and content are tailored to Danish users and clearly encourage engagement with the consultant.
